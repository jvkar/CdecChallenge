# Problem 04: Math Operations

You are given a set of functions that perform basic mathematical operations on two numbers:
addition  : +

subtraction : - 

multiplication: * 

division, : /

exponentiation, : power ^

factorial : !
Each function takes two numbers as input and returns the result of the operation.
You also have two variables a and b initialized with values.
Your task is to write a function named eval that takes these two numbers (a and b) as input and returns an object containing the results of all the mathematical operations provided by the given functions.
