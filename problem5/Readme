# Problem 05 : climbing stairs

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
For example:
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top:
1 step + 1 step + 1 step
1 step + 2 steps
2 steps + 1 step
Implement a function climbStairs that takes an integer n as input and returns the number of distinct ways to climb to the top.
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 45: The input integer n is within the range of [1, 45].
